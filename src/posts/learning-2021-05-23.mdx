## Why you fail ?

Time is the money of our life, and I like to use it in an efficient way, i don't want to learn something for months to realize that i will never need it.I think that learning something is NEVER useless but maybe you could have learnt something even more useful during that time spent. That's the reason why when i am planning to learn something new, I always try to know what I wil gain from it. Sometimes it is only because you find it fun and it is a really good reason to doing it. If no matter how much time you put in a subject and it seems that you will never reach the level of understanding you aim to achieve, listen to my listing :

### You want to understand everything

If the subject is something you love and are deeply interested in, it can disperse you into the huge informations by wanting to understand every aspects of it. No worry you are in a very good position, you only need to tweak a little bit your mindset.
