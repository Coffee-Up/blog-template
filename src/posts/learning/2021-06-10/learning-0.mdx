<p class="post-text-intro">
  During our life we want to learn new subjects that was unknown for us before.
  It's not always easy to know how to tackle it and nailed it, sometimes because
  we are not doing it the right way (spoiler: OUR way) or the subject is complex
  and we maybe a new approach from it.
  <br />
  This post will explains the basics to learn in an efficient way from my point
  of view.
</p>

<h3 id="post-template-h3-default">
  Why do you want to learn it in the first place ?
</h3>
<p>
  Time is the money of our life, and I like to use it in an efficient way, I
  don't want to learn something for months to realize that I will never need it.
  <br />I think that learning something is <b>NEVER</b> useless but maybe we could
  have learnt something even more useful during that time spent. <br />
  That's the reason why when I'm <b>planning</b> to learn something new, I
  always try to know what I wil gain from it. <br />
  There are countless reasons why we want to learn a new subject but, if we want
  to be efficient, something never change before starting : we need to ask ourself
  what this new skill or understanding will bring to us. <br />
  Learning manual skill (like rugby pass, drawing & such) is in my opinion a
  little bit different & will not be described here.
</p>

<h4>How can I know it before learning it ?</h4>
<p>
  In fact that's not an easy task to know what learning the subject in question
  will add to yourself. So you need first getting as much as basic materials as
  you can. <br />
  To give you an example, before I have started to learn about Hardware, I have searched
  on the internet what it really is, how it translate in our world today, what I
  will be able to do with it, if doing it will be fun from my preferences (that's
  the most important component IMO), if it can helps me to understand other subjects
  in my wishes list & quantify the time needed to being able to use it or create
  something with it.
  <br />
  Human's brain fights almost always against abstracts stuffs that it can't comprehend
  but I encourage highly to go over this feeling & just relax, read the subject even
  if you think you don't understand a word, because in reality : <b>you do</b>. Our
  brain is a powerfull unit, it can find patterns in a vast dataset (not as computers,
  but still) and when it reads carefully a complex subject it will connects the dots.
  You will know :
</p>
<ul>
  <li>What's linked to it.</li>
  <li>The mindset you need to have when learning it.</li>
  <li>How it works in a very abstract way.</li>
</ul>
<p>
  When you know all these informations you will surely know better if it worth
  you attention, if not you will have to start learning it, but like I said it
  always worth it.
  <br />
  For example I wanted to learn to make video games, it's a very vaste & dense
  subject because it touched Game Design, Game Art, 3D engine with a lot of
  mathematical and programming & much more different things, so it's the perfect
  subject to talk about that.
  <br />I love technical understanding, I really enjoy it, but I am always drown
  by all the really interesting technicals aspects of everything & with a goal of
  being a Game Developer I felt into the trap of wanting to do all at once. Luckely
  I had already the mindset of taking a step back to envision what was in front of
  me. You are focus on the tiny aspects (here the fabulous technical aspects of everything)
  without trying to understand what's in front of me.
</p>
<h3>Reframe</h3>
<p>
  When you realize you're not looking at the big picture that's the time when
  you want to reframe. Reframe is an important step, you can do it for your
  goal's life & you can do it when you want to learn.
  <br />
  Before trying to learn
