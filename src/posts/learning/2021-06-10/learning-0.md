During our life we want to learn new subjects that was unknown for us before.
It's not always easy to know how to tackle it and nailed it, sometimes because
we are not doing it the right way (spoiler: OUR way) or the subject is complex
and we maybe a new approach from it.
This post will explains the basics to learn in an efficient way from my point
of view.

# Why do you want to learn it in the first place ?

Time is the money of our life, and I like to use it in an efficient way, I
don't want to learn something for months to realize that I will never need it.
I think that learning something is _NEVER_ useless but maybe we could
have learnt something even more useful during that time spent.
That's the reason why when I'm _planning_ to learn something new, I
always try to know what I wil gain from it.
There are countless reasons why we want to learn a new subject but, if we want
to be efficient, something never change before starting : we need to ask ourself
what this new skill or understanding will bring to us.
Learning manual skill (like rugby pass, drawing & such) is in my opinion a
little bit different & will not be described here.

## How can I know it before learning it ?

In fact that's not an easy task to know what learning the subject in question
will add to yourself. So you need first getting as much as basic materials as
you can.
To give you an example, before I have started to learn about Hardware, I have searched
on the internet what it really is, how it translate in our world today, what I
will be able to do with it, if doing it will be fun from my preferences (that's
the most important component IMO), if it can helps me to understand other subjects
in my wishes list & quantify the time needed to being able to use it or create
something with it.
Human's brain fights almost always against abstracts stuffs that it can't comprehend
but I encourage highly to go over this feeling & just relax, read the subject even
if you think you don't understand a word, because in reality : _you do_. Our
brain is a powerfull unit, it can find patterns in a vast dataset (not as computers,
but still) and when it reads carefully a complex subject it will connects the dots.
You will know :

What's linked to it.
The mindset you need to have when learning it.
How it works in a very abstract way.
When you know all these informations you will surely know better if it worth
you attention, if not you will have to start learning it, but like I said it
always worth it.

For example I wanted to learn to make video games, it's a very vaste & dense
subject because it touched Game Design, Game Art, 3D engine with a lot of
mathematical and programming & much more different things, so it's the perfect
subject to talk about that.
I love technical understanding, I really enjoy it, but I am always drown
by all the really interesting technicals aspects of everything & with a goal of
being a Game Developer I felt into the trap of wanting to do all at once. Luckely
I had already the mindset of taking a step back to envision what was in front of
me. You are focus on the tiny aspects (here the fabulous technical aspects of everything)
without trying to understand what's in front of me.

### Reframe

When you realize you're not looking at the big picture that's the time when
you want to reframe. Reframe is an important step, you can do it for your
goal's life & you can do it when you want to learn.
