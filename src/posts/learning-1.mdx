<p class="post-text-intro">
  Time is the money of our life, and I like to use it in an efficient way, I
  don't want to learn something for months to realize that I will never need it.
  <br />
  I think that learning something is NEVER useless but maybe we could have
  learnt something even more useful during that time spent. That's the reason
  why when I'm planning to learn something new, I always try to know what I wil
  gain from it. <br />
  Sometimes no matter how much time you put in a subject it seems that you will never
  reach the level of understanding you aim to achieve.

<h3 id="post-template-h3-default"> We want to understand everything</h3>

If the subject is something you love and are deeply interested in, it can disperse you into the huge informations by wanting to understand every aspects of it. No worry you are in a very good position, you only need to tweak a little bit your mindset.
